# Life After CodeClan

Hello, and thanks for visiting us. This is as close as anything that
exists to an "official" website for the post-CodeClan liquidation
efforts to support student studies. We should be clear up front that
this has no connection to CodeClan, and does not in any way represent
an effort to continue the organisation by other means. Everyone
involved is either a redundant ex-CodeClan employee, or an
unaffiliated volunteer.

Those legal niceties out of the way, here's what we know right now.

## Support is on the way

There are active efforts underway by a core of former CodeClan
instructors to help the impacted cohorts with continued studies,
although there might be a short hiatus (~1 week) while we scramble to
get the logistics in place to do this. Cohorts are being contacted on
a community Slack.

We're engaging with individuals, tech communities and companies to
help us build the kind of varied, multi-faceted learning experience
that CodeClan used to offer to students. If you work in Scottish tech,
we'd appreciate your help.

## Individuals and companies are helping

We're profoundly grateful for all offers of support. If you can do any
of these things, please [connect and volunteer on Community
Lab](https://app.communitylab.app/groups/codeclan-student-support):

- Be a mentor to students
- Run a workshop
- Be a guest speaker
- Provide feedback on student projects
- Hire one of our graduates!

If you'd like to help, please [engage with the page at Community
Lab](https://app.communitylab.app/groups/codeclan-student-support). Although
we appreciate messages of support and emails, please understand that
CodeClan's infrastructure is now in the hands of the liquidators -
email, calendar, Zoom accounts, GitHub organisation
accounts. Responding to individual messages as well as trying to spin
up a replacement teaching platform is a lot to process, so you'd be
making our jobs a little easier in this difficult transitional period.

## Crowdfunding

Stuart Ure - a student in one of the impacted cohorts - has a
[crowfdunding appeal open on
GoFundMe](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/codeclanbootcamp). We
know these are challenging times for everyone, but if you spare any
amount to help fund the completion of students' courses we would be
very grateful.

## This site

We're going to post updates on any developments in here, and also on
the Community Lab site.
